Dear [% username %],

The Archive of Our Own runs entirely on the work of our tireless volunteers and donations from you (https://goo.gl/g4AOcz). The Archive is planning to add new servers to help host our over three million fanworks! It's thanks to you we have this amazing growth.

Your donations keep AO3 running, along with other Organization for Transformative Works projects like Fanlore, Legal Advocacy, and our peer-reviewed academic journal Transformative Works and Cultures. If you're able to do so, please donate today https://goo.gl/g4AOcz ) !

Would you like your very own AO3 umbrella, mug, or hat? Did you know you can donate a small amount each month to save towards one of our thank-you gifts? Use our recurring donation form ( https://goo.gl/oCcn7Q ) and let us know which gift you would like your donations counted towards!

If you;ve already donated, thank you! We appreciate your support. If you have questions about donating, don't hesitate to contact the Development & Membership committee ( http://www.transformativeworks.org/contact_us/ ).

Thank you from all of us at OTW and AO3!
