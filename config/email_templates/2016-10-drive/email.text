Dear [% username %],

The Archive of Our Own relies entirely on donations from you (https://goo.gl/3SNBXD) and volunteer work. In just six months the AO3 has added half a million fanworks, bringing us to a total of two and a half million fanworks! We're growing every day, thanks to you.

Your donations help keep the Archive running, along with other Organization for Transformative Works (OTW) projects like Fanlore, Open Doors, Legal Advocacy, and our peer-reviewed academic journal, Transformative Works and Cultures. If you are able to do so, please donate today: https://goo.gl/3SNBXD

If you have already donated during this drive, thank you! Your support means a lot. If you have questions about donating, please contact the OTW Development and Membership committee: http://transformativeworks.org/contact_us/contact-development-and-membership/

Thank you from everyone at the Organization for Transformative Works and the Archive of Our Own!
