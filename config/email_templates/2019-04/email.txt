Dear [% username %],

The Organization for Transformative Works and all its projects, including the Archive of Our Own, are run by volunteers and funded by your donations. Help support the Archive by contributing today (http://otw.news/e1e8c)!

With a donation of US$10, you can become a voting member of the OTW and receive a special member icon. With a donation of US$50 or more, you can choose to receive one of our thank-you gifts, like an AO3 stress ball or notebook! If you'd like a gift but canâ€™t pay all at once, there's the option to set up a recurring donation (http://otw.news/dc286)--just let us know (http://www.transformativeworks.org/contact_us/) what you're saving up for. And if you'd like to double your impact, ask your employer about donation matching!

To those who have already donated during this drive: you have our sincerest thanks. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Development & Membership committee (http://www.transformativeworks.org/contact_us/).
 
Thank you from all of us at the Archive of Our Own and the Organization for Transformative Works.
