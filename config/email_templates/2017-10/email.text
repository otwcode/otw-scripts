Dear [% username %],

The Archive of Our Own runs entirely on the work of our tireless volunteers and donations ( https://goo.gl/ah1kw1 ) from you. This year, we hit a record 3 million works across 25,000 fandoms!

In addition to funding the Archive of Our Own, your donations keep all of the projects by the Organization for Transformative Works running as well. These projects include Fanlore, Legal Advocacy, and our peer-reviewed academic journal Transformative Works and Cultures, as well as Open Doors, which imports at-risk fanwork archives to AO3 so you can keep accessing fanworks that might otherwise be lost. If you're able to do so, please donate today ( https://goo.gl/ah1kw1 )!

Want to show off your OTW support with a hat, tumbler, or umbrella? Did you know you can donate a small amount each month to save towards one of our thank-you gifts? Use our recurring donation form ( https://goo.gl/4BHhzX  ) and let us know which gift you would like your donations counted towards!

If you've already donated, thank you! We appreciate your support. If you have questions about donating, don't hesitate to contact the Development & Membership committee ( http://www.transformativeworks.org/contact_us/ ).

Thank you from all of us at the OTW and AO3!
